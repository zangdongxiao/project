## Research Question

Based on the dataset can we preict the housing price of Boston

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

- opportunity we have data collected from boston housing price history.
- challenge the data we have can help to preict the housing price.  
- action find two the most related features that we can use to predit the housoing price.
- resolution (using heatmap to find out 2 features and using LinearRegression modle to predit the price)

### Introduction
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/
This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.

The Boston house-price data of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. ‘Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air’, J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978. Used in Belsley, Kuh & Welsch, ‘Regression diagnostics …’, Wiley, 1980. N.B. Various transformations are used in the table on pages 244-261 of the latter.

The Boston house-price data has been used in many machine learning papers that address regression problems.

### Methods

using heatmap to find out which are the most related features that affect the housing price.
base on these two features find out the linear relation between the features and the price.

### Results
